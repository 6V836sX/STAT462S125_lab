```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

We load a dataset recording the distance `dist` for reaching a full stop from a speed `speed`. 

```{r}
df_braking <- read.csv("braking.csv")
```

Next we plot `dist` versus `speed` to see the effect of speeding on the braking distance.

```{r}
plot(df_braking$speed, df_braking$dist)
```
